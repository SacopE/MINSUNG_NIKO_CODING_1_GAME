The goals for this phase include:

 - Decide on a game idea and core goal
 - Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
 - Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
 - Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Note your decisions here so you can refer back to this later in the project
