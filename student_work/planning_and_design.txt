Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:
Snake

Game Rules:
10 x 9 board
You cannot run into any of the walls

Major Game Elements:
There are apples that spawn around the board that you must go collect.
After every apple that you collect you get one tile bigger.

Gameplay Process:
You spawn in as a 1x3 snake and must eat all of the apples.
After every apple you eat you get one tile longer.
You will always get longer and not thicker but you can contort your body however nessesary.
The game ends after you collect enough apples so that your body fills the entire board.
