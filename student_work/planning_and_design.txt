Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea & Core goal:
Snake
Collect all of the apples and make you snake take up the entire board

Game Rules:
5 x 5 board
The snake that you control cannot run into any walls or itself

Main Objects:
Snake that becomes larger
Apples for the snake to collect
Walls for the snake to run into

Major Game Elements:
There are apples that spawn around the board that you must go collect.
After every apple that you collect you get one tile bigger.
for every apple you eat you will gain ten points while having a maximum of 230 points
Every second is subtracts one point from the total, so completing the game faster will get you more points

Gameplay Process:
You spawn in as a 1x2 snake and must eat all of the apples.
After every apple you eat you get one tile longer.
You will always get longer and not thicker but you can contort your body however nessesary.
The game ends after you collect enough apples so that your body fills the entire board.

Expansion Ideas:
After beating the first board you will unlock larger boards that you can also beat
